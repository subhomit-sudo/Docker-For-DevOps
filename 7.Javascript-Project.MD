============================================

⚛️ React 18
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs). React 18 is a major version that introduced several new features:

🔑 Key Features of React 18:
Concurrent Rendering: Allows React to interrupt rendering to prioritize more important updates.
Automatic Batching: Groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance.
useTransition Hook: Helps manage UI transitions smoothly.
Streaming Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Improves performance for server-rendered apps.
startTransition API: Marks updates as non-urgent to keep the UI responsive.
🌐 Next.js
Next.js is a React framework built on top of React. It adds powerful features for building production-ready web apps.

🚀 Key Features of Next.js:
File-based Routing: Pages are created by adding files to the pages/ directory.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG): Improves SEO and performance.
API Routes: Build backend endpoints directly in the same project.
Image Optimization: Built-in support for optimized images.
Middleware and Edge Functions: Run code closer to the user for faster response times.
App Router (from Next.js 13+): A new routing system with React Server Components support.

🔓 Open Port 3000 in Security Group
Ensure port 3000 is open in your cloud provider's Security Group (SC group) to allow external access.

🌐 Access the App

http://<PublicIP>:3000
Replace <PublicIP> with your server's public IP address.

🧰 Troubleshooting
If the app isn't running, check the container logs:

docker logs portfolio-app
