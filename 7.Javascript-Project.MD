============================================
‚öõÔ∏è React 18
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs). React 18 is a major version that introduced several new features:

üîë Key Features of React 18:
Concurrent Rendering: Allows React to interrupt rendering to prioritize more important updates.
Automatic Batching: Groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance.
useTransition Hook: Helps manage UI transitions smoothly.
Streaming Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Improves performance for server-rendered apps.
startTransition API: Marks updates as non-urgent to keep the UI responsive.
üåê Next.js
Next.js is a React framework built on top of React. It adds powerful features for building production-ready web apps.

üöÄ Key Features of Next.js:
File-based Routing: Pages are created by adding files to the pages/ directory.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG): Improves SEO and performance.
API Routes: Build backend endpoints directly in the same project.
Image Optimization: Built-in support for optimized images.
Middleware and Edge Functions: Run code closer to the user for faster response times.
App Router (from Next.js 13+): A new routing system with React Server Components support.
